Hi, my name is Anton. 
I'm 14 years old, and I have a lot of ideas in my head that I want to implement.
I'm interested in creating games on unity, but at the moment I'm learning c++.
In the future I plan to make my own programming language and release a lot of new games into the world.
This profile will be used as my portfolio.

That's all for now, but the future is not far off.
